# <Weather App>
## Description
The motivation for this application is to give users accurate weather readings instantaneously in any United States city. I built this homework because I wanted to test my API skills to use them on my project. My app solves the problem of not having an accurate reading of the weather in your respective area. I learned that when Javascript pulls API's, I'm getting real-time data and fluctuations in the weather. 
## Installation
The steps needed to install my project were signing up on https://openweathermap.org/ and getting my own API key. After that, I found a current weather API and decided to go with that. After that I made an index file and an assets folder holding a Javascript and CSS file. As always, I started with the index file and laying the framework down. I made script tags and linked all the files to the HTML and a link to google fonts. The CSS was a bit more extensive for this project but the Javascript had me including the weather API link and a bunch of statements such as 'then', 'const' and 'fetch'.
## Usage
In order to utilize my app, all you have to do is insert your city name and the weather conditions for that moment in time will appear.
